	Law forbids murder, theft and the like by prescribing that if someone commits murder or theft, he ought to be punished by capital punishment or imprisonment. Law commands payment of one's debts by prescribing that if a person does not pay his debts, civil execution ought to be directed against his property. By attaching a sanction to a certain behavior, law qualifies this behavior HeinOnline -- 34 Tul. L. Rev. 272 1959-19601960] LEGAL PHILOSOPHY 273 as a delict, as illegal, and makes the contrary behavior the content of a legal obligation. In this sense, law is a coercive order. Moral norms too, forbid or command a certain behavior, and some of them prescribe the same behavior as law, but without attaching to the contrary behavior a coercive act as a sanction. A moral order is a normative, but not a coercive order. Insofar as moral norms are created by acts of human beings, by the founder of a religion, such as Moses, Jesus or Mohammed, or by custom, there are many different moral orders, valid at different times within different societies. Then the moral value has only a relative character. A definite legal order may or may not correspond to a certain moral order; but the validity of the legal order does not depend on its correspondence to a moral order. It may, from the point of view of a certain moral order, be considered as morally good or morally bad. That a legal order is morally good, means that it is just; that a legal order is morally bad, means that it is unjust.
