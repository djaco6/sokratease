	The norm-creating act is a fact which exists in time and space and can be perceived by our senses. This fact can be described in an is-statement. But this fact is different from its meaning - that is, the norm - which is the object of jurisprudence, and which cannot be described in an isstatement, but only in an ought-statement. It is true that jurisprudence refers also to the procedure by which the legal norms are created; but only insofar as this procedure is prescribed or authorized by legal norms. The law regulates its own creation. Only the norms that prescribe or authorize the norm-creating acts are the object of jurisprudence. Jurisprudence deals with the legislative process only insofar as that process is determined in the constitution, and with the judicial and administrative processes only insofar as they are determined in statutes or rules of customary law. HeinOnline -- 34 Tul. L. Rev. 271 1959-1960272 TULANE LAW REVIEW [Vol. XXXIV The constitution, the statutes, the customary law are norms, and only as such the object of jurisprudence. That a legal norm, in order to exist - and that means: in Â·order to be valid- must be created by an act, which is a fact existing in time and space, is not the only relationship between norm and fact. A norm may or may not be obeyed and applied by a certain human behavior which actually takes place in time and space. A legal order as a whole and the particular legal norms which form this legal order are to be considered vaiid only if they are, by and large, obeyed and applied, only if they are effective. But their validity must not be confused with their effectiveness. Effectiveness is merely a condition of, but not identical with, validity.
