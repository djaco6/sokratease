	Although the principles of logic, such as the law of contradiction and the rules of inference, apply only to statements which can be true or false, they are indirectly applicable also to legal norms, insofar as statements about norms, statements affirming the existence, that is, the validity, of legal norms are subjected to these principles. Two statements of which one affirms the validity of a norm prescribing that men ought to behave in a certain way, and the other the validity of a norm prescribing that men ought not to behave in this way, contradict each other, just as two statements of which the one affirms that something is, and the other that it is not. If the one is true the other must be false. Two conflicting norms can be described as valid norms only by statements which contradict each other. In this sense we may say of conflicting norms that they "contradict" each other. Consequently two conflicting norms cannot be considered to be valid at the same time. Thus the science of law conceives of its object as a logical unit: a system of noncontradictory norms. Although law is a norm, not a fact, there is nevertheless an essential relationship between norm and fact. The norm is - as pointed out - the meaning of a fact, the fact by which the norm is established. The fact by which a norm is established or, metaphorically speaking, created, is the act of an individual or a series of such acts intentionally directed at the behavior of another. If it is a legislative act or custom, it is a general norm. If it is a judicial or administrative act, it is an individual norm.
