	As a matter of fact, each legal order corresponds more or less to a definite moral order prevailing within a ruling group whose interests determine the law-creating process; and hence is considered, from the point of view of this moral order, as just. But at the same time it may be more or less contrary to a moral order prevailing within other groups, even of the same society for which the legal order is valid. Hence law must be distinguished from justice. A statement about the law must not imply any judgment about the moral value of the law, about its justice or injustice; which, of course, does not exclude the postulate that the law should be just. However, since there are not one justice, but many different and even contradictory ideals of justice, the postulate should never be raised without specifying which of these many justices is meant. Exactly as the Pure Theory of Law separates law from nature and thus jurisprudence from natural science, it separates law from morals, and thus jurisprudence from ethics. In these two respects it is a "pure" theory of law. The Pure Theory of Law is a theory of positive law. Positive law is a coercive order whose norms are created by acts of human beings - by legislative, judicial or administrative agencies, or by custom constituted by acts of human beings. Legislative, judicial, and administrative agencies are human beings in their capacity as organs of the state. In so far as the law is created by these agencies, we say that the law is created by the state. We interpret the law-creating acts of definite human beings as "acts of state" ; we attribute the function actually performed by a definite human being to the state.
