	But, what is the state, and what is its relation to the law? The Pure Theory of Law shows that an act performed by a human being is interpreted as act of state only if this act is HeinOnline -- 34 Tul. L. Rev. 273 1959-1960274 TULANE LAW REVIEW [Vol. XXXIV determined in a specific way by the legal order; that to attribute the performance of this law-creating act to the state means to refer the act to the legal order by which the act is determined; that the state as an acting person creating the law is nothing else but the personification of the legal order which regulates its own creation; and that a state as a social order or political organization is this coercive order we call law; that a state imagined as a real being different from the law is the hypostatization of this relatively centralized legal order, or of its personification. Thus the Pure Theory of Law dissolves the misleading dualism of state and law prevailing in the traditional legal and political theory. The Pure Theory of Law takes into consideration only positive law, norms created by acts of human beings. It does not take into consideration norms emanating from other, i.e., superhuman authorities. Therefore it excludes from the province of jurisprudence any divine law, i.e., law supposed to be created by God or a godlike entity. Consequently it excludes also so-called natural law, law which- according to the natural-law doctrine - is immanent in nature. Law - meaning norms regulating human behavior - can be immanent in nature only if nature is considered to be a legislator. To consider nature as a legislator implies to attribute a will to nature.
