	In opposition to a theological or natural law doctrine the Pure Theory of Law, as a positivistic theory, does not see the reason for the validity of positive law in a divine or natural order, different from and above the positive law. It rejects the view that a positive law is valid only if its content corresponds to a divine or natural order, i.e., valid only if the positive law is just. It considers every positive law - every coercive order which is established by acts of human beings and is by and large effective - as valid, without regard to its justice or injustice. The question of the reason for the validity of positive law - the question why the norms of any coercive order ought to be obeyed and applied - is, according to the Pure Theory of Law, to be understood as the following question: What is the logical condition under which the subjective meaning of the law-creating acts - that men ought to behave in a certain way - can be interpreted as their objective meaning? In answering this question we must be aware that it is logically impossible to infer from the statement that something is or is done, the statement that something ought to be or to be done, just as it is logically impossible to inf er from the statement that something ought to be or to be done, the statement that something is or is done. This logical principle applies also to the fact of an act of will whose subjective meaning is that something ought to be done. From the fact that an individual commands that another individual ought to behave in a certain way, it does not follow that the other individual ought to behave in this way.
