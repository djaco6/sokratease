	A legal norm may be valid before it becomes effective. When a statute is applied by a court for the first time after its adoption by the legislative organ, hence before the statute could become effective, the court applies a valid law; it can apply the law only if the law is valid. But the statute loses its validity if it has not become, or when it ceases to be, effective. The fact that a legal norm becomes effective must be added to the fact that it is created by an act; otherwise it can no longer be considered as valid. But just as the act by which the norm is created is not identical with the norm - which is the meaning of this act - the effectiveness of a legal norm is not identical with its validity. The doctrine which defines law as a fact is based on the erroneous identification of the norm with the act whose meaning the norm is, and of the validity of the norm with its effectiveness. By avoiding this erroneous identification, the Pure Theory of Law separates jurisprudence, describing norms in ought-statements, from natural science describing facts in is-statements. This is the first reason that it is called a "pure" theory of law. The second reason is that it separates jurisprudence from ethics. The science of ethics describes norms, as does jurisprudence, but the norms described by ethics are not legal norms, but rather moral norms. The difference between legal and moral norms consists in that the former prescribe a certain behavior by attaching to the contrary behavior a coercive act as a sanction. A sanction is a forcible deprivation of life, freedom, property, or other values, as a reaction against a behavior considered by the legal authority as harmful to society.
