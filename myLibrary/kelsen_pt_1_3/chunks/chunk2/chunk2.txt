	A norm may have not only the character of a command but also the character of an authorization; by a norm a person may confer upon another person the power or capacity of issuing commands. God authorized Moses to issue commands to the Jewish people; God conferred upon him the authority of a legislator. The constitution of a state authorizes a certain individual or a body of individuals to issue statutes - general norms - and statutes authorize courts and administrative organs to issue individual norms - judicial decisions and administrative commands. Finally, a norm may have the character of a permission, that is to say, by a norm a person may be allowed to do something which without that permission is forbidden. For example, a general norm forbids killing, but by a special norm, restricting the first one, it is permitted as self-defense. These are the three functions of a norm: command or prescription; authorization; permission.

The logical dualism of the "ought" and the "is" implies the impossibility of inferring from the statement that something ought to be or to be done, the statement that something is or is done, and vice versa.
