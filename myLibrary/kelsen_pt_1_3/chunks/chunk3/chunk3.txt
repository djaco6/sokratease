	We are aware of the "ought" as of something different from the "is" if the former is the meaning of an act of an individual intentionally directed at the behavior of another individual. If, for instance, A commands B to do something, we describe the act by the statement that A wills that B do something. This is an is-statement. But the meaning of the act can be described only by the statement that B ought to do something, not by an is-statement such as that B does or will do what A commands. That B ought to do something is the subjective meaning of the act of command; the meaning the act has from the point of view of the commanding individual. But it is not necessarily also the objective meaning of the act of command, that is the meaning the act has from the point of view of the addressee and of a third person not concerned. That B ought to do something is considered to be also the objective meaning of the act of command if this act is authorized. Then, its meaning is called a norm. To the question as to the difference between the subjective and objective meaning of acts prescribing a certain behavior, we shall return later. According to the Pure Theory of Law, law is norm, or, more exactly, a set of norms, a normative order. Since a normative order is the object of jurisprudence, and the meaning of norms is that something ought to be done, that men ought to behave in a certain way, jurisprudence can describe its object not as natural sciences describe their object- in is-statements - but only in ought-statements.
