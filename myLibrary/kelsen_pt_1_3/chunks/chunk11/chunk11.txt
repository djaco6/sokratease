	This is either an animistic superstitution or a theological interpretation of nature, based on the belief that nature is created by God and hence a manifestation of God's absolutely good will. This is a metaphysical assumption incompatible with any scientific cognition and hence also with a science of law. The same objection applies to that version of the natural-law doctrine which pretends to find the just norms of human behavior in the nature of man, particularly in his reason. Reason is the faculty of cognition. By our reason we are able to know, to understand or comprehend something which is given as an object of cognition, independently of this mental operation. To set a norm, to prescribe something, is a function of will, and human will is a psychic phenomenon totally different from human reason. Human reason can know norms after they have been created by acts of human will, but it cannot create norms. Only in God may reason and will be considered to coincide; only of God can people believe that knowing what ought to be is identical with willing that it ought to be. It is the old myth of the tree of knowledge: when men eat of the fruit of this tree, they will be like God, knowing good and evil. To God, knowing good and evil is the same as commanding the good and forbidding the evil. Only if the reason of man, as a being created by God in His own image, is part of the divine reason, can it be considered to be at the same time a norm-creating will, a so-called "practical reason." This self-contradictory notion, HeinOnline -- 34 Tul. L. Rev. 274 1959-19601960] LEGAL PHILOSOPHY 275 which is the basis of a law of reason, is of theological origin.
